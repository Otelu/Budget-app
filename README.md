Budget Manager

This Python code defines a Category class that allows users to manage budgets for different categories like food, clothing, and entertainment. The class provides methods for depositing funds, withdrawing funds, transferring funds between categories, and checking the current balance. It also includes a method to generate a formatted summary of the budget.

Additionally, there is a function create_spend_chart that creates a percentage-based bar chart to visualize the spending distribution across different budget categories. The chart is designed to be clear and informative, making it easy to understand how funds are allocated.

Use this code to efficiently manage your budget and gain insights into your spending habits.
